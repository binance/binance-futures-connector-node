# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/orb-intro/
orbs:
  # See the Node orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  node: circleci/node@5.2

jobs:
  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
  build-and-test:
    # Specify the execution environment. You can specify an image from Docker Hub or use one of our convenience images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/executor-intro/ & https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#executor-job
    docker:
      # Specify the version you desire here
      # See: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
      - image: cimg/node:16.10

    # Add steps to the job
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/jobs-steps/#steps-overview & https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#steps
    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout
  
      # The node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.
      - node/install-packages:
          # If you are using yarn, change the line below from "npm" to "yarn"
          pkg-manager: npm
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: npm test

# Orchestrate jobs using workflows
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/workflows/ & https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#workflows
workflows:
  sample: # This is the name of the workflow, feel free to change it to better match your workflow.
    # Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run.
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
